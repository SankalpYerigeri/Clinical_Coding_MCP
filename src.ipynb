Physical examination revealed a firm, distended abdomen with tenderness to palpation, a positive Blumberg sign, and pain elicited by coughing, all highly suggestive of appendicitis. An ultrasound of the abdomen/pelvis confirmed the diagnosis of scute appendicitis. The patient underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy under general anesthesia.
